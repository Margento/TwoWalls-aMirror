misery played out in the collective tone
					botanical enclaves really loved some
			   infinitely		see appendices to find
       selected quotes that have been chosen 	promoted
jazz and rock music during the communist regime 
sometimes at the expense of their own lives…
dear northwest, how does Zepparella love thee?  
let me count the ways… soul sister
analog environments				unmentionable dimension
			I dreamed of 747’s over geometric farms
		clotting like crystals				sunburst is the theme
informed by ancient Italy      we trained
our own poetry-corpus-informed word embeddings 
that proved significantly better than the ubiquitous GloVe ones
a niche mode of engagement with the audiences
