That’s not art or poetry…
… you’re caught in redundancy, it’s because we’ve reached uroboreality, 
							a point of spatiorhetorical choke
so     borrow cash on the finest  terms
										the writings of Church fathers,   hexameters
there’s more trilling trigonometry in trees — that description of discipline
integrative decompositional performance, the multi-
				graph poem			                      instances of use
   		no node (just) an ode        snuffed out the flame of rebellion
	make our country grow				like a field of patience dock
					gravediggers uncover, excavate, bury,
then reverse the process 			            radio broadcasting
                  and not confusion, obfuscation
									    terms that breathe the air of verse
                       what you see is what you get
											 no one’s been disappointed yet
an assassination possibly commissioned by the Romanian Securitate
				stoned someone to death                   also used
	     translation creatively								     gatekeepers
					Pittiș Show											   literary genres
										 network, work, war, weir...
   how it might feel to inhabit the space of such an enunciation
         translation is a form of writing through the words of
																others
