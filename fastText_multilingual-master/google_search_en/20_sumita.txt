Cast Away: Poems for Our Time by Naomi Shihab Nye / The 2019 - 2020 Young People's Poet Laureate promoted awareness of trash, / our need to recycle, and don't use plastics but reuse implements

The Shape of Things by Sumita Chakraborty | Poetry Foundation
 Sumita Chakraborty’s poem “Image 004” appears in the April 2020 issue / I have an archival spirit. I take pictures of food not (most of the time) to post, or even to look back at later, / but just to have taken; instead of deleting emails, I sort them into folders and download them / at irregular intervals, compressing them into zipped files; / my drives contain files and folders through which I can trace my life back at least ten years

 Seventeen heads line the shelves at the Copenhagen warehouse where Thomas Dambo has been riding out the coronavirus pandemic. / “ But I didn’t kill them — I’m just getting them ready for my next project ”

While tossing orange peels and coffee grounds in the garbage might seem inconsequential, / sending food waste to landfills has a real impact on climate change
