and make sure the two parallels… intersect
if the code becomes unrecognizable to its original author, then who speaks?
				The Doors			speaking/spoken			reality 
		sticky finger licking chicken   we were floating
the logic in a rushing medium   the 3-year-old girl
		    who insisted on helping me change my strings
before the show										iterative string of code
			 got a date I can’t be late, for the high hopes hailla ball
algorithms are our best (un)translatable poems    these poems
our most (poly)rhythmical algorithms         the air we breathe
					  		full of light and movement, lines
							as graceful as the figures drawn
the importance of the message rather than its originality or accuracy
				 what other language act transforms over time
	              it’s better not to write at all
               than write like this     rhizomatic performance
		Gretchen Menn			singing in the sunshine
laughing in the rain			    slipping into the voice
	at night the states whistle      anyone can live
the subject position of an algorithm is both speaking and spoken
			Surprized Kitty 										an n-ode of n-dimensional
										song throngs. Flow growth...
