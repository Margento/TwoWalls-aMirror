rather than an effect of the much cited US cultural
imperialism     these pieces score the frustration
		of de facto digital efforts to apprehend
ecochemical calamity as archaeology        bou
		a poetry incontinence		     rule-based
but in translation						production in poetic forms
			a clarity of mind applied				the sun
don’t shine above the ground     ain’t a-goin’ down to Oxford Town
aspiring to algorithmic subjectivity is, in fact, the experiment
        video recorder			rock is still very much a howl
	sunet       monologues					I lend money to
  you even long-term,    	          cash is on the spot
         rate is going up 				automata have their way
did you send your insignia		      up a greased flagpole
during a time when literature and music were the only
refuge for many young people		   whose death won’t be investigated	  
ourselves as poem drivers				  self-organized artifact
			(4)D-rivers					         for far too long romantic thoughts
			data rivers					       like yours have subjugated verse
