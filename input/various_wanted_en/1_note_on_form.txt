Note on Form

As the original is informed by a(n irregular) four-beat meter / — at times congealing into trochaic, at others into iambic tetrameter — 
I took the opportunity to pick up where I left off when practicing syllabics in România cu amănuntul (Romania by Retail, Vinea 2008) 
as a transition from the then dominant free-verse prosody in Romanian verse to irregular accentual-syllabic meters 
(consequently adopted afterwards in the bilingual, English and Romanian, Nomadosofia / Nomadosophy, Max Blecher 2012). 
Here I moved on to accentual verse (4 strong stresses per line) in both my English and Romanian translation / (arguably for the first time consistently in contemporary literature in Romanian, / but with a lineage going as far back as the 1600s when, as argued in a previous publication, / Dosoftei wrote his syllabics with an underlying accentual pattern), 
which helped to get Rushton’s “rock ’n’ roll beat” across without getting stuck in the usually larger Romanian syllabic quantities.
Speaking of rock prosody, while the author develops a Bo-Didley-inspired Hopkins-style theory and practice of rhythm, 
for my part I chose to go with Zep and Zappa. 
From the former, I borrowed Jimmy Page’s concept of the “alchemy of the band” / involving the multiple rhythms and energies clashing as the artists play (that is, fool) around, releasing, checking, releasing them again… 
From the latter, the notion of “anything, anytime, anywhere” / and the politically charged manifold ways of tapping into traditional avant-gardes and absurdist theater. 
This allowed me to adopt Gretchen Menn’s approach to (translation as) classic (rock) covers, / faithful and transgressive at the same time, and to work with language(s) / as translational and multilingual in, and of, themselves. 
Multilayered lines within reticular stanzas thus made up a cross-lingual complex / system, dynamic, and therefore “precarious" and “on the edge of chaos.”
(in Raluca Tanasescu’s chaos-theory-inspired translation studies & digital humanities terms) 
Cross-lingual here includes programming languages and coding scripts as well, / and the ways in which they occasioned the emergence of a computational prosody / behind some of the formal features of this translation. 
While for the first two sections I ran the topic modeling algorithm on words, / for the third one I included phrases as well, / and for the fourth whole lines and, towards the end, couples of stanzas, / thus playing with rhythms ranging from syllable and word-based to intra/inter-linear and multi-stanzaic.
